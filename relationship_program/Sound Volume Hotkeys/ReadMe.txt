4 Active Keys - hotkeys software

  Modern operating systems offer the increasing number of breathtaking
  features that bring computing to the new edge. These days, computers
  transform into entertainment and information centers of our homes and
  offices. There is one major drawback of such miraculous integration,
  however - computers are still bound to traditional hierarchical interfaces
  which makes controlling various system actions rather a memory quiz than a
  comfortable living.

  Each and every new piece of computer functionality involves using new
  software which, in turn, uses multiple menus, icons and buttons to access
  its features. It is fairly easy to control one application behavior but what
  if there are five or twenty of them? Aren't you missing your favorite remote 
  controller? Wouldn't it be great to use one controller to manipulate all the 
  functionality of your PC? Is it a dream that never comes true?

  No! Softarium.com is here ready to offer its amazing Active Keys software
  that will turn your ordinary keyboard into full-blown remote controller for
  your entire system. That's right! No more miles of mouse moves and injured
  wrists, no more hassle and interface havocs! Just total control of your
  entire Windows system using any keyboard at hand!

  Active Keys is a powerful yet easy-to-use tool for creating and managing
  keyboard shortcuts for any system action. Active Keys allows creation of
  custom keyboard hot keys definitions for otherwise hardly accessible
  functions. Among those are CD Audio and WinAmp actions, sound volume,
  windows resizing, opening Internet addresses, folders, documents, sending
  e-mails, starting applications and much more:

  Just imagine being able to control Windows Media Player, screen resolution
  and color depth, start screen saver, insert current time and date or custom
  text with just one key press! Throw in the intuitive interface and small
  memory and system resources usage footprint and you will understand this
  title worth a try! So go ahead and download free trial now!
